**CollabTask** is a collaborative task management backend built with **ASP.NET Core 8** following **Clean Architecture** principles.

It provides a real-time Kanban board API supporting multi-user collaboration, optimistic concurrency, and strong domain modeling.

---

## Current Version — v1.0.0

The backend is ready for public release.

- Full documentation and XML comments across all layers.
- Optimistic concurrency with `ETag` / `If-Match` support.
- Domain-driven Unit of Work (`IUnitOfWork`) persistence orchestration.
- Clean separation of Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers.
- Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration, ≥75% coverage).

For detailed technical explanations, see [TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md](docs/TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md).  
For version history, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Architecture Overview

**CollabTask** is structured into four independent layers:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **Domain** | Entities, Value Objects, invariants, and business rules. |
| **Application** | Use cases, validation, and transactional orchestration via `IUnitOfWork`. |
| **Infrastructure** | EF Core persistence, repositories, interceptors, migrations, and DI setup. |
| **API** | Minimal APIs exposing project, board, and task endpoints (REST + Realtime). |

Clean boundaries allow for isolated testing and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Projects & Members** — Project-based collaboration with role-based access policies.  
- **Kanban Board** — Lanes, Columns, Tasks, Notes, Assignments, and Activities.  
- **Realtime Updates** — SignalR hub (`/hubs/board`) for project-scoped event broadcasting.  
- **Optimistic Concurrency** — Enforced through `RowVersion`, `ETag`, and `If-Match` headers.  
- **Automatic Activity Logging** — Task activities (create, edit, move, ownership, notes) logged automatically.  
- **Strong Domain Model** — Value Objects and invariants protecting data consistency.  
- **Clean Architecture** — Strict layering and dependency direction.  
- **Extensive Testing** — Unit, integration, and concurrency tests with enforced coverage.

## Local Development

**Requirements:**  
- .NET 8 SDK  
- Node.js ≥ 20  
- Docker Desktop

### Commands
```bash
npm run dev [args]     # Run development environment
npm run prod [args]    # Run production profile
```

**Common args:**  
`rebuild | up | down | health | logs`

Default API URL: **http://localhost:8080**

---

## Testing

Run test suites through unified scripts:

```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:infra
npm run test:all
```

- Unit tests cover domain and application logic.
- Integration tests validate persistence, concurrency, and endpoint behavior.

---

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions pipeline ensures:
- Build and test execution with coverage enforcement (≥75%).
- Container image build verification.
