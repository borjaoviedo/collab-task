## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Backend**
  - Full project and membership management (CRUD).
  - Entities: `Project`, `ProjectMember` with role hierarchy (`Owner`, `Admin`, `Member`, `Reader`).
  - `DomainMutation` result type introduced for consistent repository outcomes.
  - Authorization policies by project role (`ProjectOwner`, `ProjectAdmin`, `ProjectMember`, `ProjectReader`).
  - Services: `ProjectMemberService`, `ProjectMembershipReader`, and supporting repositories.
  - Policy registration via `AddProjectAuthorization()` in `AuthorizationExtensions`.
  - Integration and unit tests for:
    - Role-based authorization handlers.
    - Membership reading and role updates.
    - Repository and persistence contracts.
  - Infrastructure refactor for repository and service consistency (merged from `refactor/api-repository-services`).

### Changed
- Unified dependency injection for Application and Infrastructure layers.
- Repository signatures updated to return `DomainMutation`.
- Controllers now rely on Application services instead of direct repository calls.
- CI and test suites updated to reflect new structure.

### Notes
- Major backend milestone before tag `v0.2.0`.
- Frontend still pending integration with new endpoints and policies.

  - Docker setup for dev and prod with `compose.yaml`.
  - CI workflows for build, test (unit + integration), and coverage enforcement.
