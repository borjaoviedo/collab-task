## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added
- **Documentation**
  - Added **comprehensive XML documentation** across the entire backend ensuring **full codebase coverage** and **API clarity**.
- **Concurrency & Contracts**
  - Added **strict handling** for `If-Match` and `ETag` headers across all endpoints.
  - Implemented **`RequireIfMatch()`** and **`RejectIfMatch()`** endpoint filters to enforce **optimistic concurrency**.
  - Added **`428 Precondition Required`** responses to OpenAPI for clarity on precondition enforcement.
- **OpenAPI**
  - Updated **`openapi.json` summaries and descriptions** for all endpoints.
  - Added **detailed endpoint documentation** indicating member/admin roles and concurrency behavior.

### Changed
- **Domain**
  - Added **validation refinements** across value objects (`UserName`, `ProjectName`, etc.) enforcing stricter rules via guard clauses.
  - Extended **domain invariants** for ownership constraints: **exactly one active project owner** per project, validated through **unique filtered index**.
  - Improved consistency of **concurrency tokens** and **audit behavior** across domain entities.
  - Added XML summaries to all **domain types**: entities, value objects, enums, and domain events.

- **Application**
  - Introduced the **Unit of Work (UoW)** pattern via `IUnitOfWork` abstraction to coordinate **atomic persistence boundaries** and unify **transaction outcomes**.
  - Application services now delegate persistence commits to **`IUnitOfWork.SaveAsync()`** instead of direct **`DbContext.SaveChangesAsync()`**.
  - Reorganized namespaces for **`TaskItemChange`** into `Application.TaskItems.Changes`.
  - Replaced **`DomainMutation`** results with refined **`PrecheckStatus`** outcomes for repository operations.
  - Rewrote repository and service interfaces to use **domain value objects** (`TaskTitle`, `TaskDescription`, etc.).
  - Improved **audit interceptor** (`AuditingSaveChangesInterceptor`) integration via **`IDateTimeProvider`**.
  - Standardized **XML documentation** across all interfaces and service abstractions.

- **Infrastructure**
  - Added implementation of **`UnitOfWork`** in `Infrastructure.Data.UnitOfWork`, translating EF Core persistence outcomes into `DomainMutation` results.
  - Extended **dependency injection** to register `IUnitOfWork` and refactored **`DependencyInjection.cs`** with clearer separation between concerns (**DbContext**, interceptors, repositories, services).
  - Moved **`DbInitHostedService`** from `Infrastructure/Initialization` to `Infrastructure/Data/Initialization` for structural consistency.
  - Improved **`AppDbContext`** with provider-specific configurations:
    - **SQL Server:** enforced **CHECK constraints**, **filtered unique indexes** (e.g. active owner rule).
    - **SQLite:** added converters and **rowversion emulation**.
  - Updated **EF Core interceptors** and **auditing logic** for accurate timestamping.
  - Added new migrations **`Rename_TaskNote_AuthorId_To_UserId`** and **`InfraSchemaFinalization`** (final schema cleanup).

- **API**
  - Normalized **endpoint summaries and descriptions** to follow **REST** and **concurrency conventions**.
  - Updated all **Create/Edit/Delete endpoints** to clearly indicate authorization level (**Member-only**, **Admin-only**) and **ETag requirements**.
  - Renamed OpenAPI **`operationId`** fields for consistency:
    - `Tasks_Get` â†’ **`Tasks_Get_ById`**
    - `TaskNotes_Get` â†’ **`TaskNotes_Get_ById`**
    - `TaskNotes_ListMine` â†’ **`TaskNotes_Get_Mine`**
    - `TaskNotes_ListByUser` â†’ **`TaskNotes_Get_ByUser`**
  - Unified **response contracts for concurrency** (`409 Conflict`, `412 PreconditionFailed`, `428 PreconditionRequired`).

- **Testing**
  - Major **refactor of integration and unit tests**:
    - Introduced **`TestHelpers.Api.*`** modules for reusable test operations (**Auth**, **Projects**, **ProjectMembers**, etc.).
    - Added **UoW usage in tests** to verify **transactional persistence** across repositories.
    - Replaced inline setup code with **centralized helpers** improving readability and reusability.
  - Adjusted **test project references** (`TestHelpers.csproj` now references `Api.csproj` for endpoint helpers).
  - Extended **test cases** to cover **concurrency validation** (e.g. `Create_With_IfMatch_Header_Returns_400`).

- **Contracts**
  - Rewritten and normalized the entire **`openapi.json`** file with new summaries, operation IDs, and improved header documentation.

### Fixed
- Corrected multiple inconsistencies between **ETag/If-Match usage** and repository concurrency behavior.
- Fixed **row version propagation** on update and delete operations across all board entities.

### Removed
- Deleted placeholder files `.gitkeep`.

### Notes
- This version completes all refactors, documentation, and preparation for public release.
- Backend is fully documented, consistent with Clean Architecture, Unit of Work pattern, and optimistic concurrency standards.
- **Tag created: `v1.0.0`

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-17
### Added
- **Backend / Realtime**
  - Integrated **SignalR** for real-time board updates.
  - Added **BoardHub** with group management per `project:{id}`.
  - Introduced **BoardNotifier** service for broadcasting events to clients.

  - Extended testing suite:
    - `BoardEventSerializationTests`, `BoardNotifierTests`, and all handler tests (`TaskItem`, `TaskNote`, `TaskAssignment`).

### Changed
- **Application / Write Services**
  - Refactored all board write services to integrate **Mediator-based event publication** after persistence commits:
    - **TaskItemWriteService** â†’ emits `TaskItemCreated`, `TaskItemUpdated`, `TaskItemMoved`, `TaskItemDeleted`.
    - **TaskNoteWriteService** â†’ emits `TaskNoteCreated`, `TaskNoteUpdated`, `TaskNoteDeleted`.
    - **TaskAssignmentWriteService** â†’ emits `TaskAssignmentCreated`, `TaskAssignmentUpdated`, `TaskAssignmentRemoved`.
  - Method signatures now include `projectId` to ensure precise event scoping.
- **API / Composition Root**
  - Added `.AddSignalR()` registration and configured dependency injection for realtime components.
  - `WebApplicationExtensions.MapApiLayer()` exposes the `/hubs/board` SignalR endpoint.
- **Testing & CI**
